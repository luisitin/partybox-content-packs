# Verification record

Stage: claimed historical30-name pipeline; implementation checks are recorded below as they actually finish.
Prior read-only source research precedes this claim. Normal proxy/TLS/checksum verification remains enabled.

## Original source access

```sh
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ
curl --head --location --max-time 20 --connect-timeout 10 --silent --show-error --write-out '\nhttp_code=%{http_code} url_effective=%{url_effective} ssl_verify_result=%{ssl_verify_result}\n' 'https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip'
```

Recorded 2026-10-07T15:05:29Z: curl exit56, proxy CONNECT403, origin000. This checks access to the specific candidate, not its existence. ssl_verify_result0 does not verify origin TLS when CONNECT fails before TLS.

## Retained research export and preflight

```sh
PYTHONPATH=/tmp/c05-tools python /tmp/c05-export-research.py
```

Historical read-only research export exit0 used pyreadr0.5.7/narwhals2.26.0. It produced500 selected-name research records and30-name subset, not a completed pack. The exported illustrative facts are omitted from this job. C05 regeneration uses the independently installed frozen pyreadr0.5.3/pandas2.2.3/numpy2.3.5 family instead; its checks are recorded separately.

Retained preflight independently recomputed both30/500 annual exports and matched their archived aggregates. Source has1924665 rows, no nulls or duplicate(year,name,sex), minimum published count5; complete analysis years1880–2009 appear overall. The30-name CSV has3707 records,193 missing annual cells,390 decade cells,364 with10 published years and12 without any published rows. No source requests/exporter reruns are inferred from local artifact checks.

Prior Random(17) comparison sampled30 of500, overlaps this first30 sample in one name, and is programmatic. All30 peak decades agreed; only9 peak counts agreed. Both archives are SSA-derived; zero manual checks and zero independently sourced short facts are claimed. See CONFLICTS.

## Claim and dependencies

```sh
python3 /tmp/queue_blockers.py claim
git show origin/main:CLAIMS.md
git branch --show-current
npm --cache=/workspace/.npm-cache ci --ignore-scripts --no-fund --no-audit
```

Actual claim37cf5c5 reached main at17:03:49 UTC; remote main records C01–C04 BLOCKED and C05 codex-queue. Lowest unclaimed jobC05 was selected, then job/C05-name-your-baby created from main. Frozen npm install exit0,8 packages; scripts disabled, normal integrity/TLS verification. No force push or secret extraction.

```

Core suite: 15/15 passed in 8.867 seconds, no skipped/cancelled tests; 10,000 aggregation and 10,000 selection differential cases, 6,018 property rounds from seeds 1/2/3 plus 1,000 stored crypto-generated seeds. CLI: 15 calls, four successes and eleven expected rejections. Independent SQLite and Python arithmetic agrees across 390 decade cells/30 summaries; five exact representatives plus total 35,928,729 and 193 omitted years are embedded in tests. This is independent arithmetic, not an independent factual publisher.


## c05-source-validation-evidence.json

Source suite: 5/5 passed in 21.145 seconds; two uncached full-RDA regenerations match fixture and each other. Sixteen actual extractor CLI calls include two successes and fourteen expected rejections. One additional synthetic decoder process rejects 38 boundary cases. Consumed year/name/sex/n values validate before coercion/filtering; unused prop has only column-presence validation. Source bytes and rejected existing outputs are preserved.


## Full npm test and runner correction

```sh
PARTYBOX_SOURCE_PYTHON=/workspace/.partybox-source-venv/bin/python PARTYBOX_SOURCE_FILE=/workspace/.partybox-source-cache/c05/c05-babynames.rda npm test
```

First run: all 20 tests passed, but the mutation runner returned failure after incorrectly classifying ordinary errors inside executed tests as infrastructure crashes. It caught 20 mutations and incorrectly marked M05/M10–M13 invalid. The overly broad ERR_TEST_FAILURE string guard was removed: Node24 uses that code for ordinary failed tests too. Baseline counts, complete TAP cases, file/import-crash detection, timeout/cancellation/skip checks and compiled byte/hash restoration remain enforced. No test assertion was weakened. Initial evidence is retained in /tmp/c05-initial-run-infrastructure-failure.log and /tmp/c05-initial-mutation-classification-report.json.

Corrected retry log: 20/20 tests; runner full baseline 20/20 and core baseline 15/15; all 25 syntax-valid semantic mutations caught with 15 core tests executed each; zero skips/cancellations; four compiled files restored byte-for-byte with matching SHA256; all five data/schema/seed checksums passed. Full npm process completion is confirmed separately before delivery.

The selected environment entered starting status during work and was waited to ready. Files and branch remained present. The observed clock jumped from17:26 to18:17 UTC; the30-minute milestone interval was exceeded during that transition. This is recorded as a delivery gap, not a timely-push claim. Current source expansion and independently sourced facts remain active; no BLOCKED status, PR or green CI is claimed for C05.
